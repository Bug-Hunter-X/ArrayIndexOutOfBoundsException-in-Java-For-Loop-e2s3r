# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java
This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `Bug.java` file contains code that produces this exception, while `BugSolution.java` shows the corrected version.
The error arises from an off-by-one error in a `for` loop, attempting to access an array element that doesn't exist.  The solution involves properly checking the array bounds before accessing elements.
